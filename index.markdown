At DirectPlugins I build game engine plugins to accelerate Android devices. I build plugins for Unreal and Unity (coming soon).

DirectVideo provides high quality GPU accelerated video playback for Android devices. It allows you to playback high resolution 4k, 8k videos which aren't playable in Unreal Engine. For example for use of 360 content on Meta Quest headsets. If you're having problems with video playback being slow on Unreal, you need this plugin.

DirectCamera gives full camera control and GPU accelerated capture into Unreal Engine on Android devices. It goes beyond the default camera plugin in the following ways:

* Multiple camera support (e.g. for both Meta Quest 3 front cameras, or capture front and back cameras at once on phones.)
* Full (blueprintable) control of camera settings, resolution etc.
* GPU acceleration of capture
* Render camera stream to texture via the standard mediaplayer API.
* Capture JPEG images from the camera.
* Capture RAW images in DNG format.
* Capture images to CPU as raw YUV buffers.
